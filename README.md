# Command-Line Shonen Showdown Version 0 (pre-alpha)
Objectives:
  - To create a core gameplay system for Shonen Showdown that can be applied to later graphical versions of the game
  - To build a basic structure for integrating AI players of different paradigms, including neural networks as well as hand-designed algorithmic AIs.
  - To create a non-functional class diagram for P2P and Client/Server online modes, knowing what kind of data would need to be requested when by the program to create functioning online play. True P2P online play is the goal of version 0.1.
